Technology choices:
Backend:
    - Done with NodeJS, Express and implemented MongoDB database. I'm most familiar with this.

Frontend:
    - Done with React. Reason being that implementing better visual components is easier with React frontend. I also wanted to challenge myself as this is my third time coding reactjs and first fullstack code. 


Installation guidelines:
